Compilation
-----------

To compile both the client and the server :
    $ make

To clean the directory (delete object files) :
    $ make clean

To clean the directory (delete object files and binaries) :
    $ make mrproper



Running the program
-------------------

Run the server with :
    $ ./server PORT

Run the client with :
    $ ./client HOST PORT

You can then, from the client, write the messages you want to send to the server.
For now, the only way to leave the server is a Ctrl+C.

Here is an example of session :

    ----------------------
    server point of view :
    ----------------------
    
    $ ./server 2048
    ========> Client 1 connected
    Client 1: hello
    Client 1: it's me
    ========> Client 2 connected
    Client 2: hey
    Client 2: i'm here too !
    Client 1: great

    ------------------------
    client 1 point of view :
    ------------------------
    
    $ ./client 127.0.0.1 2048
    Connecting to 127.0.0.1:2048...
    hello
    it's me
    great

    ------------------------
    client 2 point of view :
    ------------------------
    
    $ ./client 127.0.0.1 2048
    Connecting to 127.0.0.1:2048...
    hey
    i'm here too !
